This might become a to do list application.  Right now the project is very early in its lifetime.  There is no necessary server action at this point, so this 
can be run without a web server.  

Upon page load, a div with an input field pops up and "registers" itself.  If you're running on a web server, it sends info to the server.  If not, it prints 
the object it would send to the console.  

Upon input into the text box or div drag, this app sends info to the server or console.  The div can be dragged and dropped arbitrarily around the screen.

The div can also be resized.  It took me a while to realize that resize is built into css now.  This being yet another instance where I am not all knowing.  

I am posting this to GitHub very early for my apprentice's benefit.  

This is a "study" like a study in the field of fine art. Right now it's not meant to do anything so much as I am trying to go back to "lesson 1," in the Zen 
sense, of web dev.  I'm re-thinking how to do stuff.
